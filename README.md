stimulus_sinusoid.wav, stimulus_brownnoise.wav, stimulus_cicadas.wav and stimulus_catspurring.wav are the four types of stimuli used during the experiment. They are equalised in loudness based on the frequency response of the Shure SE215-K headphones and the free-field response. As a result, if you are not using the same headphones, the loudness may appear unequal.
Questionnaires.docx and Questionnaires.pdf are files containing screenshots of the Matlab interfaces use to complete the various questionnaires. For the laterality and musicality, a list of the different questions or statements is provided.
